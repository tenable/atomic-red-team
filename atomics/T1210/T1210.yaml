  description: |
    The Zerologon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) consists in an elevation of privilege when an attacker establishes a vulnerable Netlogon secure channel connection to a domain controller, using the Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC).
    This module will test the cryptographic flaw in the protocol against a domain controller. 
    Privileges required: none, this vulnerability can be exploited pre-authentication. However for test purposes, the machine should be domain-joined.
